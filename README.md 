Showing the “Clean” water and discharge from Dave & Ruth Little’s backyard.

                        What do you think this is doing to the surrounding backyards—especially ours if their backyard looks like this?
                        
                         
                         
                         You are all welcome to contact me to make an appointment to see the unhealthy environment this has caused, this is so ILLEGAL!
                         
                          
                          
                          So the City of Walker can site me over a picture Ruth Little brings to the office stating I was blocking the “Natural” water way—never
                          
                          To investigate the matter (I was really trying to fill in the holes they had made by discharging their water directly into my backyard). But
                          
                          NO ONE will cite the Littles for the ILLEGAL actions they are doing……
